## Key Insights from My Hotel Performance Dashboard

1️) Revenue Trend

Total Revenue stands at 66M INR.

Revenue performance is strong from January to July, but I can clearly see a sharp decline after August, with the lowest point around September–October.
This indicates a clear seasonal slowdown in the second half of the year, which needs better planning and revenue strategy during low months.

2️) Department Revenue Contribution

From the departmental breakdown, F&B is the highest revenue contributor (~15M).
After that, Spa and Events are performing well.
Banquets and Rooms are slightly lower but are contributing almost at a similar level.
Overall, F&B is clearly the strongest performing department in terms of revenue.

3) Occupancy Trend

Occupancy levels drop significantly after August, especially in September, which shows a major decline.
There is a slight recovery afterward, but not enough to match the first half of the year.
The revenue decline directly aligns with the occupancy drop, showing a strong correlation between occupancy and total revenue.

4️) Guest Volume Insight

Total Guests: 134K
F&B handles the highest guest volume at around 30K, while Banquets has the lowest (~24K).
This confirms that F&B is not only driving revenue but also attracting the highest footfall in the property.

5️) Complaints Analysis

Total Complaints: 4,263
Resolved: 2,092
Resolution Rate: 49%
This is concerning, as nearly half of the complaints remain unresolved, indicating a serious service gap.
Departments with the highest complaints are:
F&B (957)
Spa (887)
This needs immediate operational focus.

6️) Guest Feedback

Average Feedback Score: 3.76 / 5
The rating is moderate — not poor, but definitely not excellent.
This aligns with the high number of complaints and low resolution rate, suggesting that service quality improvements are necessary.

## Business Decisions

1️) Focus on Low Season Strategy

Since revenue drops heavily in September and October, I believe the hotel should focus more on low-season planning.
We can introduce special discounts during these months to attract more bookings. Combo packages like Room + Spa or Room + F&B deals can also help increase occupancy.
Additionally, targeting corporate meetings and small events during low months can help stabilize revenue.

2️) Improve Complaint Resolution

The current complaint resolution rate is only 49%, which is quite low.
I think the hotel needs a faster and more structured complaint tracking system. There should be clear department-wise accountability so that issues are resolved quickly.
A realistic target would be to increase the resolution rate to at least 80%.

3️) Invest More in F&B

F&B is the highest revenue-generating department, so it deserves more focus and investment.
The hotel can introduce premium menu options, start loyalty programs for repeat guests, and train staff on upselling techniques to increase revenue further.

4️) Improve Service Quality in Spa & F&B

Spa and F&B have the highest number of complaints, so service quality improvement is necessary.
Regular staff training sessions should be conducted, and guest feedback should be monitored on a weekly basis to identify and fix recurring issues.

5️) Increase Revenue per Guest

Currently, revenue per guest is 492.93, which has room for improvement.
The hotel can introduce add-on services, bundle packages, and encourage upselling at check-in to increase overall guest spending.

## Conclusion

This dashboard helps management make data-driven decisions to improve revenue, service quality, and overall hotel performance.
